#   In this first example we will look at variables in python and string(sentence) manipulation.
#   The variable name is going to hold a string of charcters which will be you name or anything you like. 
#   We will then print your name to the screen along with a greeting. 
#   This is string concatination and we will see how this can be very useful later in the workshop

name = "Jonathan"
